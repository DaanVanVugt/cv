# curriculum vitae

* Based on [resume](https://github.com/chmduquesne/resume) by Christophe-Marie Duquesne.
* Modified to fit my needs and embellished.

## To use:

* Upate `metadata.yaml`.
* Run `make all`.
* It is possible that some of the html beautifying tricks found in `scripts/modify_html.sh` have to be partly rewritten.
* Only tested on Linux.

## To do:
* Only the html part is workin so far.
* The extension to pdf needs some additional html tuning.
* Not sure whether to also pursue Word and txt.
