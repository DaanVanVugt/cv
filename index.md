>  Through my background in general energy engineering, as well as my Ph.D. specialized in nuclear fusion science, I am well suited to tackle any problem where analytical insight and higher mathematics is necessary, without losing sight of the big picture. This is backed up by extensive computational physics knowledge. As working in a dynamic multicultural and multilingual environment challenges and motivates me, I am always looking for new opportunities to learn. Furthermore, I enjoy sports, music, traveling, mathematics and reading.

    *[Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/) Â· [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/) Â· [ITER Organization](http://iter.org/)*

    My Ph.D. research project involved furthering the understanding of an important class of instabilities that occur in toroidal magnetic confinement devices for nuclear fusion, called *high-n* instabilities. 
    A dedicated mathematical theory was developed [[Weyens et al, 2014, P.o.P, 21, 4]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263054885_Three-dimensional_linear_peeling-ballooning_theory_in_magnetic_fusion_devices) and a high-performance numerical code designed, PB3D [[Weyens et al, 2017, J.c.P, 330]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309620864_PB3D_A_new_code_for_edge_3-D_ideal_linear_peeling-ballooning_stability), in modern Fortran, making use of the MPI protocol for parallelization. 
    Part of the work was done at the [ITER Organization](http://iter.org/), a multi-billion dolar project where world's most advanced nuclear fusion research reactor is being built.

Research
--------
Jan 13 - now
:   <a name="PB3D_project"></a>**PB3D**
    
    *Peeling-Ballooning in 3-D*
    
    PB3D (**P**eeling-**B**allooning in **3**-**D**} is a numerical code developed during as part of my doctoral research project.
    It is capable of analyzing in an efficient manner the peeling-ballooning stability of toroidal magnetic confinement devices for nuclear fusion.
    These so-called high-n instabilities are of importance in thee next generation of devices as they are easily excited and have the potential to couple plasma from the hot interior to the cold reactor walls.
    PB3D is unique in that it is geared towards these high-n instabilities, in general 3-D configurations, while allowing for the plasma edge to be perturbed [[Weyens et al, 2017, J.c.P, 330]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309620864_PB3D_A_new_code_for_edge_3-D_ideal_linear_peeling-ballooning_stability).
    
    For my postdoctoral research I currently emply PB3D to investigate certain 3-D effects, such as the usage of resonant magnetic perturbations for ELM control--an important class of periodic instabilities that degradate confinement, with applications to ITER.
    
    The PB3D code is freely available and well-documented.
