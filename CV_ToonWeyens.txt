  Through my background in general energy engineering, as well as my
  Ph.D. specialized in nuclear fusion science, I am well suited to
  tackle any problem where anlytical insight and higher mathematics is
  necessary, without losing sight of the big picture. This is backed up
  by extensive computational physics knowledge. As working in a dynamic
  multicultural and multilingual environment challenges and motivates
  me, I am always looking for new opportunities to learn. Furthermore, I
  enjoy sports, music, traveling, mathematics and reading.

Experience

Jan 13 - Now

    POSTDOCTORAL MONACO FELLOW

    _ITER Organization_

    The numerical code PB3D, developed as part of my Ph.D. project is
    put to use at the ITER project to support the development of
    next-generation toroidal magnetic fusion devices. Have a look at the
    PB3D project below.

Jan 12 - Dec 16

    DOCTORAL RESEARCHER

    _Universidad Carlos III de Madrid · Eindhoven University of
    Technology · ITER Organization_

    My Ph.D. research project involved furthering the understanding of
    an important class of instabilities that occur in toroidal magnetic
    confinement devices for nuclear fusion, called _high-n_
    instabilities. A dedicated mathematical theory was developed [Weyens
    et al, 2014, P.o.P, 21, 4] and a high-performance numerical code
    designed, PB3D [Weyens et al, 2017, J.c.P, 330], in modern Fortran,
    making use of the MPI protocol for parallelization. Part of the work
    was done at the ITER Organization, a multi-billion dolar project
    where world’s most advanced nuclear fusion research reactor is
    being built.

    ONLINE SPECIALIZATION - DEEP LEARNING

    _Coursera_

    The topics include the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how
    to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine
    learning projects. Neural network techniques such as convolutional
    networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He
    initialization, and more are treated. There is a focus on case
    studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading,
    music generation, and natural language processing. These ideas are
    practiced in Python, and use is made of software packages TensorFlow
    as well as Keras.

    workload: 60-100 hours

    PB3D

    _Peeling-Ballooning in 3-D_

    PB3D (Peeling-Ballooning in 3-D} is a numerical code developed
    during as part of my doctoral research project. It is capable of
    analyzing in an efficient manner the peeling-ballooning stability of
    toroidal magnetic confinement devices for nuclear fusion. These
    so-called high-n instabilities are of importance in thee next
    generation of devices as they are easily excited and have the
    potential to couple plasma from the hot interior to the cold reactor
    walls. PB3D is unique in that it is geared towards these high-n
    instabilities, in general 3-D configurations, while allowing for the
    plasma edge to be perturbed [Weyens et al, 2017, J.c.P, 330].

    For my postdoctoral research I currently emply PB3D to investigate
    certain 3-D effects, such as the usage of resonant magnetic
    perturbations for ELM control–an important class of periodic
    instabilities that degradate confinement, with applications to ITER.

    The PB3D code is freely available and well-documented.
