Experience

Jan ’17 - Current

    POSTDOCTORAL MONACO FELLOW

    _ITER Organization_

    Responsible for the investigation of 3-D effects on Edge-Localized
    Modes (ELM) stability at the ITER Organization, a multi-billion
    dolar project where the world’s most advanced nuclear fusion
    research reactor is being built. Using the numerical code PB3D,
    developed as part of my Ph.D. project. Have a look at the PB3D
    project below.

Jan ’12 - Dec ’16

    DOCTORAL RESEARCHER

    _Universidad Carlos III de Madrid · Eindhoven University of
    Technology · ITER Organization_

    Designed a research project dedicated to furthering the
    understanding of an important class of instabilities that occur in
    toroidal magnetic confinement devices for nuclear fusion, called
    _high-n_ instabilities. A dedicated mathematical theory was
    developed [Weyens et al, 2014, P.o.P, 21, 4] and an optimized
    numerical code designed, PB3D [Weyens et al, 2017, J.c.P, 330], in
    Fortran, making use of modern High-Performance parallel
    computing (HPC) techniques.

    ONLINE SPECIALIZATION - DEEP LEARNING

    _Coursera intermediate, by Andrew Ng_

    The topics include the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how
    to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine
    learning projects. Neural network techniques such as convolutional
    networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He
    initialization, and more are treated. There is a focus on case
    studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading,
    music generation, and natural language processing. These ideas are
    practiced in Python, and use is made of software packages TensorFlow
    as well as Keras.

Projects

    PB3D

    _Peeling-Ballooning in 3-D_

    PB3D (Peeling-Ballooning in 3-D} is a numerical code developed
    during as part of my doctoral research project. It is capable of
    analyzing in an efficient manner the peeling-ballooning stability of
    toroidal magnetic confinement devices for nuclear fusion through the
    mathematical mimization of a functional that leads to a generalized
    eigenvalue equation. These so-called high-n instabilities are of
    importance in the next generation of devices as they are easily
    excited and have the potential to couple plasma from the hot
    interior to the cold reactor walls. PB3D is unique in that it is
    geared towards these high-n instabilities, in general 3-D
    configurations, while allowing for the plasma edge to be perturbed
    [Weyens et al, 2017, J.c.P, 330].

    For my postdoctoral research I currently emply PB3D to investigate
    certain 3-D effects, such as the usage of resonant magnetic
    perturbations for ELM control–an important class of periodic
    instabilities that degradate confinement, with applications to ITER.

    The PB3D code is freely available and well-documented.

    PYLGRIM

    _Elementary Shortest Path Problem with or without Resource
    Constraint_

    Python implementation of some promising algorithms for the
    elementary shortest path problem from recent publications. Currently
    these include [Di Puglia Pugliese et all, 2016, Comput Optim Appl,
    63] and [Boland et all, 2006, Oper Res Lett].

    The ESPPRC problem is NP-hard, so the solution of it in an efficient
    manner is a interesting mathematical and computational problem.
    Though a high-performance implementation in C++ is currently on its
    way, this python package was created to have easy access to some of
    the most modern algorithms and to benchmark and learn from them.
